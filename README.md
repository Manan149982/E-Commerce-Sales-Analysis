# E-Commerce Analysis Project (Python-[Plotly])
## Project Title: E-Commerce Sales Analysis
This project analyzes sales data from an e-commerce store to uncover trends and insights that can drive business decisions.
## Features:
- Sales performance analysis
- Category-wise and sub category-wise breakdown
- Profit and loss trends
- Key visualizations: line graphs, bar charts, pie charts, etc.
## Key Insights:
- **Monthly Sales Trends**: Analyze sales trends over time, identifying peak sales months and overall performance.
- **Sales by Category and Sub-category**: Breakdown of sales by category to identify top-performing product categories and sub-categories.
- **Profit Analysis by Category and Sub-category**: Identify which product categories are generating the highest profit margins.
- **Monthly Profit Trends**: Analyze profit trends across months, determining periods of high profitability.
- **Customer Segment Analysis**: Explore sales and profit distribution across different customer segments to optimize targeting strategies.
## Project Creation Process

### Step 1: Data Acquisition
The project started with obtaining an e-commerce sales dataset. I sourced the dataset from an open data repository (or Kaggle) which contained transactional data, product information, and customer details. The data included the following columns:
- **Order ID**: Unique identifier for each order.
- **Product Category**: Category of the product.
- **Quantity Ordered**: Number of units sold.
- **Sales Amount**: Total sales value for the order.
- **Profit**: Profit generated from the sale.
- **Customer Segment**: Information about the customer (e.g., Consumer, Corporate, Home Office).
  
### Step 2: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
I cleaned the dataset to ensure it was in a usable format. This involved:
- Handling missing or null values.
- Removing duplicates.
- Converting date fields to a consistent format.
- Creating new features (e.g., extracting month/year from the order date).
- Filtering out any outliers or irrelevant rows to ensure accuracy in the analysis.
  
### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
After cleaning the data, I performed EDA to understand the distribution of key variables. I used Pandas and NumPy to calculate:
- Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.).
- Correlations between sales, profit, and other features.

### Step 4: Data Visualization
To make the data more interpretable, I created visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn:
- **Monthly Sales Trends**: Line charts to show how sales fluctuate over time.
- **Sales by Category**: Bar charts to visualize sales across different product categories and sub-categories.
- **Profit Analysis**: Profit margins visualized by category to identify top-performing categories.
- **Customer Segment Performance**: Breakdown of sales and profits by different customer segments (e.g., Consumer, Corporate).

### Step 5: Insights & Conclusion
Based on the analysis and visualizations, I derived key business insights, such as:
- Which months have the highest sales and profits.
- Which product categories are the most profitable.
- How sales performance varies by customer segment.

# E-Commerce Analysis Project (Python-[Plotly])
## Project Title: E-Commerce Sales Analysis
This project analyzes sales data from an e-commerce store to uncover trends and insights that can drive business decisions.
## Features:
- Sales performance analysis
- Category-wise and sub category-wise breakdown
- Profit and loss trends
- Key visualizations: line graphs, bar charts, pie charts, etc.
## Key Insights:
- **Monthly Sales Trends**: Analyze sales trends over time, identifying peak sales months and overall performance.
- **Sales by Category and Sub-category**: Breakdown of sales by category to identify top-performing product categories and sub-categories.
- **Profit Analysis by Category and Sub-category**: Identify which product categories are generating the highest profit margins.
- **Monthly Profit Trends**: Analyze profit trends across months, determining periods of high profitability.
- **Customer Segment Analysis**: Explore sales and profit distribution across different customer segments to optimize targeting strategies.
## Project Creation Process

### Step 1: Data Acquisition
The project started with obtaining an e-commerce sales dataset. I sourced the dataset from an open data repository (or Kaggle) which contained transactional data, product information, and customer details. The data included the following columns:
- **Order ID**: Unique identifier for each order.
- **Product Category**: Category of the product.
- **Quantity Ordered**: Number of units sold.
- **Sales Amount**: Total sales value for the order.
- **Profit**: Profit generated from the sale.
- **Customer Segment**: Information about the customer (e.g., Consumer, Corporate, Home Office).
  
### Step 2: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
I cleaned the dataset to ensure it was in a usable format. This involved:
- Handling missing or null values.
- Removing duplicates.
- Converting date fields to a consistent format.
- Creating new features (e.g., extracting month/year from the order date).
- Filtering out any outliers or irrelevant rows to ensure accuracy in the analysis.
  
### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
After cleaning the data, I performed EDA to understand the distribution of key variables. I used Pandas and NumPy to calculate:
- Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.).
- Correlations between sales, profit, and other features.

### Step 4: Data Visualization
To make the data more interpretable, I created visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn:
- **Monthly Sales Trends**: Line charts to show how sales fluctuate over time.
- **Sales by Category**: Bar charts to visualize sales across different product categories and sub-categories.
- **Profit Analysis**: Profit margins visualized by category to identify top-performing categories.
- **Customer Segment Performance**: Breakdown of sales and profits by different customer segments (e.g., Consumer, Corporate).

### Step 5: Insights & Conclusion
Based on the analysis and visualizations, I derived key business insights, such as:
- Which months have the highest sales and profits.
- Which product categories are the most profitable.
- How sales performance varies by customer segment.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this E-commerce Sales Analysis project provides valuable insights into the performance of an online retail business. Through a detailed analysis of sales trends, profit margins, and customer segmentation, I was able to uncover key patterns and trends that can help optimize business strategies. The visualizations and statistical insights derived from the dataset enable businesses to make informed decisions regarding inventory management, marketing campaigns, and customer targeting.

By leveraging Python for data analysis and visualization, I was able to efficiently process and analyze large datasets, uncover actionable insights, and present them in an easily understandable format. The project not only highlights my analytical capabilities but also my ability to effectively communicate complex data in a user-friendly manner.

Future improvements to this project include building interactive dashboards for real-time analysis and incorporating machine learning techniques to predict sales and profits. This would further enhance the decision-making process for businesses in the e-commerce industry.
